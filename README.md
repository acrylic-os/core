# Acrylic

**Acrylic is, put simply, an OS that runs in your browser.**\
Despite not being an actual OS which runs on top of hardware, it acts basically as an OS. You can install apps, edit files, etc.

Currently, the latest stable version is **0.2.0**.\
The next version, 0.2.1, is in development.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that Acrylic is currently in alpha, so a lot of things are broken or just haven't been implemented yet.

## Getting started

Full guides are available on the wiki, but basically:

**Trying Acrylic**
* If you're lazy, just go to https://acrylic.anpang.lol/stable
* For a local environment, `git clone` then open `core/index.html` with Live Server

**Making an Acrylic extension**
* Get a local environment
* Copy the `extensions/example-app` folder and modify it to your liking
* Install it in Acrylic's *Settings* -> *Extensions*

## Contributing

Now that Acrylic is open-source (actually source-available), everyone, including *you*, can contribute.

If you find a bug, want to make a feature request, or anything in between, feel free to make an issue. If you know just a bit of frontend web development and have something to contribute, also feel free to make a PR.

Personally, I ([@anpang54](https://github.com/anpang54)) hate using AI in coding, and that holds true for Acrylic. I only use it when I'm really stuck, and there is not a single bit of code that is copied straight from ChatGPT. Now, I don't mind if *you* contribute with AI, but do make sure that you and others can understand the code. It should also be noted that AI is ineffective since the codebase is big.
