# Acrylic

**Acrylic is, put simply, an OS that runs in your browser.**\
Despite not being an actual OS which runs on top of hardware, it acts basically as an OS. You can install apps, edit files, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that Acrylic is currently in alpha, so a lot of things are broken or just haven't been implemented yet.

## Getting started

Full guides are available on the wiki, but basically:

**Trying Acrylic**
* If you're lazy, just go to https://acrylic.anpang.lol/stable
* For a local environment, do `git clone` then open `core/index.html` with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or any local server of your choice

**Making an Acrylic extension**
* Get a local environment
* Copy the `extensions/example-app` folder and modify it to your liking
* Install it in Acrylic's *Settings* -> *Extensions*

## Contributing

Since Acrylic is open-source (actually source-available), everyone, including *you*, can contribute.

If you find a bug, want to make a feature request, or anything in between, feel free to make an issue. If you know just a bit of frontend web development and have something to contribute, also feel free to make a PR.
