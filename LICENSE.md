Acrylic is licensed under version 1.0 of the **PolyForm Noncommercial License**.\
You probably haven't heard of Polyform licenses, but some software like [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium) are licensed under them.

**TL;DR:**
* You can use and modify Acrylic.
* You can distribute copies of Acrylic, modified or not. However, you need to credit Acrylic somewhere.
* If you are a for-profit company, you can't sell copies of Acrylic for profit, unless you have [an exception](#Exceptions).
* I can't be held liable if Acrylic commits self-destruction and you lose all of your Acrylic files. That doesn't happen very often though.

## Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the law. These terms do not limit them.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.

Otherwise, all your licenses end immediately.

<summary><b>Stuff regarding "noncommercial"</b></summary>

## "Noncommercial"

As the name suggests, the license prohibits most commercial uses of software. This would technically classify Acrylic as *source-available* instead of *open-source*, but you can still fork it and stuff, so this doesn't really have much of an effect if you're an individual or noncommercial organization.

## Exceptions

Acrylic has a noncommercial license, but this doesn't mean you outright can't use Acrylic for commercial purposes. If you want to, contact a developer (who will probably be me, [anpang54](https://github.com/anpang54)) through a Github issue.

All commercial exceptions are listed here. If they're not listed here, there's nothing confirming that they're valid.

**Exceptions have been given to:**
* *No one!*
